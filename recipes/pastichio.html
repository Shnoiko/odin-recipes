        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the meat sauce:</strong> Heat a deep pan over high heat and add the
                 oil and the minced beef. Let it brown, without stirring, and when the meat is no
                  longer red, stir with a wooden spatula and break any meat lumps. Cook until 
                  all the juices have evaporated, reduce heat to medium/high and add the onion 
                  the carrot, the bay leaves, the cinnamon stick, the allspice and the cloves. 
                  Stir for 5 minutes and add the wine. Wait for 1 minute for the alcohol to 
                  evaporate and add the tomato paste, the pureed tomatoes, the sugar, the salt 
                  and the pepper. When it starts to boil again, reduce heat to low and simmer 
                  until almost all of the liquids have evaporated (about 30 minutes). Remove 
                  and discard the bay leaves and the cinnamon stick.</li>
            <li><strong>In the meantime, make the pasta:</strong> Cook the pasta in a pot with
                 salted water, until al dente, according to the packaging directions.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta well, mix in the grated cheese and transfer about two-thirds 
                of the pasta to the casserole dish. Level with a spoon and cover with the meat 
                sauce. Level the meat sauce with the back of a spoon and spread the rest of the 
                pasta uniformly over the meat.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat your oven to 374F (190C)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Make the bechamel sauce:</strong> Cook the flour with the oil in a large 
                pot stirring continuously with a whisk until it starts to smell nutty. Remove 
                from the heat and add the cinnamon, the nutmeg, and the salt. Whisk to combine and 
                add the warm milk gradually, whisking constantly to prevent it from forming any 
                lumps. At first it will thicken, but as you continue to add the milk it will loosen 
                up. When all the milk is added, return to the stove and cook over medium heat, 
                whisking constantly, until it thickens. When it starts to bubble, remove from the 
                heat and let it sit on your counter for 5 minutes to cool a little. Add 1 cup of 
                the grated cheese and the eggs and whisk quickly to combine.</li>
            <li>Pour the b√©chamel sauce over the pasta, level with a spatula and sprinkle the 
                surface with the remaining grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes or until the top is golden brown with dark spots all over 
                the surface. Let it rest for 20-30 minutes before slicing for easier serving. Eat!</li>
