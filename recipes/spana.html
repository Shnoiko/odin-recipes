        <h1>A Brief Description of Spanakopita</h1>
        <p>Spanakopita is a staple Greek food that can be found in
            any bakery in Greece. On the outside, it has a crunchy layer
            of filo dough and on the inside it contains a mixture of 
            spinach and cheese. Spanakopita is mainly enjoyed as a lunch
            snack or a delicious appetizer.
        </p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>20 ounces fresh spinach</li>
            <li>10 ounces crumbled feta cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>6 green onions chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup basil chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dill</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Filo dough thawed</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheadt oven to 350.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pan and add half of the spinach until it has 
                wilted down, about 2-3 minutes. Set aside the wilted spinach, 
                and repeat with the remaining spinach. Gently squeeze the 
                spinach to get rid of excess water</li>
            <li>Combine the wilted spinach, green onions, feta, pesto, spinach,
                 ricotta, and dill in a medium bowl until all ingredients are 
                 evenly mixed.</li>
            <li>Get a 9 x 13 baking dish and spray it with olive oil on the bottom
                 and the sides. Add one sheet of phyllo dough to the bottom of 
                 the pan and fold it over so it fits in the pan. Brush the top 
                 with olive oil starting with edges to prevent cracking. Layer 
                 7 more sheets, brushing each sheet with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add the spinach and cheese mixture on top of the phyllo dough 
                and spread it over the pan evenly.</li>
            <li>Layer another 4 sheets of phyllo dough on top of the spinach-cheese
                 mixture, brushing each sheet with olive oil. Tuck any remaining 
                 overhanging dough into the pan to seal the filling. Brush the top 
                 layer generously with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Score the spanakopita into 12 squares with a knife, cutting only 
                partway through. This will make it easier to cut and prevent the 
                phyllo from breaking.</li>
            <li>Place the spanakopita in the oven and bake for 1 hour until the 
                top is crispy and golden brown.</li>
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>Thaw phyllo dough completely by placing it in your refrigerator the 
                night before</p>
            <p>Place a damp kitchen towel over the phyllo dough sheets when not in 
                use to prevent it from drying out and breaking</p>
        </ol>
